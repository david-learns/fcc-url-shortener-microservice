## Note
The freeCodeCamp tests failed during the two half days this was worked on. david-learned a few things: 1) detailed server logs will help you pinpoint the problem faster than anything else, 2) reading the documentation may not help (unusual for documentation), 3) scouring the internet may eventually give you a clue or signal what the problem is, and 4) don't give up.

For the URL Shortener Microservice challenge on freeCodeCamp you do not need to use dns.lookup() to pass the tests. The hint to use dns.lookup() ruins the definition of the word. If you do use dns.lookup(), the protocol and anything following the top-level domain needs to be stripped off in order for it to function as expected.
